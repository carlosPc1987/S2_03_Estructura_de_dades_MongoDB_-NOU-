------------------ MongoDB Data Structures – Educational Exercises------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains a series of structured exercises designed to introduce and reinforce key concepts in *data structures using MongoDB*. 
It is organized into progressive levels, each focusing on different aspects of MongoDB operations, modeling, and query logic.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

The project is divided into three main folders:

- `level1/` – Basic MongoDB operations and document manipulation
- `level2/` – Intermediate data modeling and aggregation pipelines
- `level3/` – Advanced queries, indexing strategies, and performance considerations

Each level includes practical examples and scripts to help learners understand how MongoDB handles data structures in a NoSQL environment.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the exercises locally:

1. **Install MongoDB**  
   Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine. You can download it from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/carlosPc1987/S2_03_Estructura_de_dades_MongoDB_-NOU-
   cd S2_03_Estructura_de_dades_MongoDB_-NOU-
   - Navigate to a level
3. cd level1
- Run the scripts
- 
Use the MongoDB shell or a GUI tool like MongoDB Compass to execute the .js or .json files provided in each folder.

4. Learning ObjectivesBy completing this project, you will:- Understand how MongoDB stores and retrieves data using documents and collections
- Practice CRUD operations and query filtering
- Explore aggregation pipelines and data transformation
- Learn how to model relationships and optimize queries
